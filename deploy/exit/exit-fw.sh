# Usage: exit-fw.sh up|down <interface>. Firewall of the exit server for the
# tunnel; awg-exit.conf's PostUp/PostDown call it as root (installed as
# /usr/local/sbin/vpn-exit-fw.sh). Forwarding on, NAT only for the entry
# server's tunnel address, the tunnel may not reach private or link-local
# networks (second guard), TCP MSS clamped.
# Safe to repeat: `down` removes every copy of each rule and goes on when one
# is already gone; `up` does the same first, so each rule is there once and
# the DROP rules sit above the ACCEPT, however the last run ended.
